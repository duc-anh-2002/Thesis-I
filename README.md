# Thesis I
- [x] 1. Extended the theoretical results of the pseudoconvexity of the component pseudoconvex functions via max operator.
- [x] 2. Extended the proof of convergence of the algorithm in pseudoconvex case.
- [x] 3. Provided numerical experiments to verify the correctness of the algorithm.
